# This file contains 2-shot examples of Maze Navigation with A*.
# Both the examples using the same maze, but with different `start` and `goal` nodes.
# The first example has `start = 20` and `goal = 57`. The second example has `start = 81` and `goal = 67`.
# The latter example is included to teach the model how to perform a valid graph search even when a valid path doesn't exist, i.e., the `goal` node isn't reachable from the `start` node.
# The maze is randomly generated using the random maze generation algorithm provided in the Searchformer GitHub repository: https://github.com/facebookresearch/searchformer/blob/main/searchformer/maze.py
