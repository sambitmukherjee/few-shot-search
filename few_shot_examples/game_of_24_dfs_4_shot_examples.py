# This file contains 4-shot examples of playing Game of 24 with Tree of Thoughts - Depth First Search.
# Two of the examples (`1 1 4 9` and `2 9 10 12`) are taken from: https://github.com/sambitmukherjee/tree-of-thought-llm/blob/master/src/tot/data/24/24.csv
# The remaining two examples (`1 1 9 9` and `4 6 8 11`) are deliberately constructed examples representing four numbers that cannot reach 24.
# The latter examples are included to teach the model how to perform a valid tree search even in cases where it is certain that the outcome of the search will be failure.
